// Uploads the two parts of an AMO listing that `web-ext sign` cannot: the
// listing icon and the screenshots.
//
// Neither comes out of the XPI. The icon has a multipart PATCH of its own, and
// with none uploaded a signed, reviewed add-on sits in the store behind
// Mozilla's grey placeholder. Screenshots have a separate collection endpoint
// again.
//
// Both were typed into the dev hub by hand before this existed, through
// scripts/store/amo-listing.mjs and a real browser — and that script uploads a
// screenshot only when the listing has none, because a second upload adds a
// copy rather than replacing one. So the art was a one-time fill with nothing
// keeping it in step with the repository, and the listing has shown the one
// picture somebody once dragged into a form ever since. A release is when the
// store page goes stale, so a release is when this runs.
//
// Declarative rather than incremental: the desired set is whatever numbered
// PNGs are in docs/store/amo/, and every run replaces the previews that are
// there with that set. Replacing means posting and then deleting, because this
// API has no image replace at all — PATCH on a preview accepts a new image,
// answers 200, and keeps the old one.
//
// Post first, delete second, and never the other way round. Deleting first
// reads better and is the version that got written, but it puts a window in the
// middle of the run where the live listing has no screenshots at all, and every
// way the run can end in that window ends with the store page bare: a 503, a
// 429 that outlasts its retries, a cancelled job, a runner that dies. The other
// order fails into duplicates on a public page, which are ugly, visible, and
// repaired by running it again. That is the direction to be wrong in.
//
// Safe to run on every release, including the runs where it can do nothing:
// absent credentials, an add-on that does not exist yet, and an AMO in
// read-only mode all warn and exit 0 — but ONLY before the first request that
// changes something. After that there is no benign exit left, because a green
// run is the one thing that guarantees nobody looks.
