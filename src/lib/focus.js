// would mean the state is unknown on almost every hand-off, and the rule that
// reads it would never fire.
//
// So it goes in `storage.session`: cleared when the browser closes, which is
// exactly the lifetime this has, and never written to disk. In memory as well,
// because within one run of the event page a round trip through storage on a
// blocking request is latency somebody can feel.
