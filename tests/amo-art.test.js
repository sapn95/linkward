// The things about the AMO uploader that running it does not check, and that a
// live store is a bad place to find out about. This add-on is listed and
// installable today, and its one screenshot is the one this sync deletes — so
// every failure below is a public one.
//
// A wrong HS256 signature has exactly one symptom — 401 — and at that point it
// is indistinguishable from a stale secret. The no-credentials path has to be a
// clean exit 0, because release.yml runs this step on every release, including
// the ones where the secrets were never set.
//
// Then the ones the sibling repo paid for. Its first uploader deleted every
// screenshot before posting the replacements, and treated "AMO has switched
// uploads off" as a benign exit 0 at BOTH ends of that window — so a 503
// arriving in the middle left the public listing with no screenshots at all and
// reported a successful release. A review caught it; nothing in a suite would
// have.
//
// And one this repo needs on its own. It ships to two stores out of one
// docs/store/, where 01-picker.png and 01-picker-chrome.png differ by the thing
// Firefox users install this for — the container list — and both match the
// pattern the uploader selects on. Which is why the AMO set has a directory of
// its own, and why that is worth a test rather than a convention.
